These are materials for a classroom simulation game developed for students of the [MSc in Creative Industries](https://efi.ed.ac.uk/creative-industries/) at the Edinburgh Futures Institute. It is loosely based on the [Startup Game](https://simulations.wharton.upenn.edu/startup-game/) developed by [Ethan Mollick](https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/emollick/), but it aims to be shorter, simpler, and lower-tech. It also differs in that it focuses specifically on cultural organizations.

Credit for the initial adaptation goes to [Giovanni Formilan](https://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/staff/giovanni-formilan) and [Vikki Jones](https://efi.ed.ac.uk/people/vikki-jones/).
