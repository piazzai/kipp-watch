These are materials for a classroom simulation game for students in the [MSc in Creative Industries](https://efi.ed.ac.uk/creative-industries/) at the Edinburgh Futures Institute. It is loosely based on Ethan Mollick's [Startup Game](https://simulations.wharton.upenn.edu/startup-game/), but it aims to be shorter, simpler, and lower-tech. It also differs from the original game in that it focuses specifically on cultural organizations.
